### Variations of this theme

There are some variations of this theme on the 'Variations' folder ;)

## Tweaking

Make sure to tweak themes inside the original Dystopia-Theme repository.

You can customize colors, transparency and other stuff in the file `Settings.scss` (Inside the 'Tweaking' folder). For advanced tweaks, use the Advanced folder.

Then, inside the 'Tweaking' folder, open the terminal and type `./parse.sh`, this will recreate the 'Dystopia' folder with your new settings outside the main folder.

After all of these steps, follow the Installation guide to get your new Dystopia customized theme ;)
